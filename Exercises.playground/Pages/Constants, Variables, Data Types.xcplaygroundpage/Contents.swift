 # Constants, Variables, Data Types
 
 ## Learning Goals - Programming
 
 * Goal 1
    * *Knowledge*
        * I know the difference between a constant and a variable and when it is appropriate to use each.
 * Goal 2
    * *Thinking*
        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.
 
 ## Learning Goals - Software Development
 
 * Goal 5
    * *Thinking*
        * I know the difference between syntax errors, logical errors, and run-time errors, can interpret error messages, and correct problems independently.
 * Goal 8
    * *Communication*
        * I can write human-readable programs (naming, indenting) with appropriate documentation (comments).
 
 * Goal 9
    * *Communication*
        * I can effectively use the file manager of my operating system (Finder) and source control tools (git, GitHub) to organize and back up my work.

 ### Question 1
 
 Create and initialize a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate) to represent each of these items:
 
 * Student first name
 * Student last name
 * Student's current grade
 * Student's grade for the November report card
 
 */
// Answer Question 1 below
let studentFirstName = "Zach"
let studentLastName = "Rubin"
var studentCurrentGrade = 69
let novReportCard = 89
/*:
 ### Question 2
 
 Create a constant called `myAge` of type `Int` and set it to your age. Use type inference to do this.
 
 Then create a constant called `otherAge` of type `Double` and set it to `40.0`. Use type inference to do this.
 
 Finally, create a constant called `averageAge` of type `Double` and set it to the average of `myAge` and `otherAge`.
 
 */
// Answer Question 2 below
let myAge = 15
let otherAge = 40.0
let AverageAge:Double = (Double(myAge) + otherAge)/2

/*:
 ### Question 3
 
 Create a variable that will track a person's favourite hobby. Select whatever name you feel is appropriate, but use the camel case convention when you name this variable.
 */
// Answer Question 3 below
var zachsFavouriteHobby = "Video Games"

/*:
 ### Question 4
 
 What are the advantages of using constants, which are *immutable*?
 
 Use multiple `print` statements below to answer this question.
 */
// Answer Question 4 below
print("You cant accidentally change a value if its a constant, which makes the code safer")
print("The computer knows that the value will never change, so it dosent waste processing power checking it over and over again whenever it comes up in code, this makes your code faster and more efficient")

/*:
 ### Question 5
 
 ![million](million.jpg "I demand the sum of one million dollars!")
 
 Define a constant named `randomDemand` and set the value to one million dollars, using underscores to make the value more readable.
 
 */
// Answer Question 5 below
let ransomDemand = 1_000_000
/*:
 ### Question 6
 
 Declare a variable and set it to 2017.
 
 Then declare a constant and initialize it with a short piece of text.
 
 Then, try to assign the value of the constant to the value of the variable.
 
 Does this work?
 
 If not, comment out the code that causes the error.
 
 What type of error (syntax, logical, or run-time) is this? Explain your selection.
 
 Use multiple `print` statements below to answer the question.
 
 */
// Answer Question 6 below


/*:
 ### Question 7
 
 Swift is considered to be a *type-safe* language. What does this mean for programmers using the language?
 
 Use multiple `print` statements below to explain.
